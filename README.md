# Todo Service
The Todo Service is a RESTful API designed to manage a collection of todo items. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete todos. Each todo item includes properties such as a title, description, due date, and completion status.

# Key features of the Todo Service include:

- CRUD Operations: The service supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing todo items.
- Data Persistence: Todo items are stored in a database, allowing for persistent management across sessions.
- API Design: The service exposes RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with frontend applications.
- Validation: The service ensures that data input is validated before processing, ensuring data integrity.
- Scalability: Designed to be scalable and easily extendable, the Todo Service can be integrated into larger systems or expanded with additional features.
